📌 Project Overview

This project analyses employment trends in Europe (2015–2024) with a focus on green jobs and education levels.
The goal is to demonstrate how SQL and Business Intelligence tools can be used to transform public datasets into policy-relevant insights.

🗂️ Data Sources

Eurostat employment by sector (NACE, 2015–2024)

Eurostat education and labour force data (ISCED levels)

Self-created mapping of green sectors (NACE → Green/Non-Green)

🛠️ Technologies

SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for data storage and queries

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for additional preprocessing (optional)

Power BI for visualization and dashboards
